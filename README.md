# 🌿 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using data from U.S. industries and commodities. The main goal is to understand how different sectors contribute to emissions and to visualize these patterns clearly.

## 📁 About

The data comes from Excel sheets that contain detailed information about GHG emissions by commodity and industry. Using Python and libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, this notebook helps break down emissions by year, commodity type, and region.

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- Year-wise analysis of GHG emissions  
- Commodity and region-wise breakdown  
- Visualizations to understand trends  
- Summary stats for a quick overview

## 📄 Files Included

- `GHG_Emissions_Prediction.ipynb` – the main Jupyter notebook for analysis  
- `SupplyChainEmissionFactorsforUSIndustriesCommodities.xlsx` – the dataset used in the notebook

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- openpyxl (for reading Excel files)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository  
2. Make sure Python and the required libraries are installed  
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code  
4. You can try filtering or modifying parts of the code for deeper insights

## 🎯 What You Can Learn

- How to work with real-world Excel datasets in Python  
- How to clean and visualize data  
- Basic insights about how emissions are distributed across industries

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi, I'm Shushmitha — a BTech AIML student interested in data analysis and how it can be used to solve real-world problems like climate change 🌎. This is a small project from my internship work where I explored GHG emissions data.

Feel free to explore or use parts of this for learning purposes!
